# Weather Dashboard

Description: By entering a city name, you get a comprehensive report on teh daily weather as well ats teh upcoming five days. City searches are saved in the side bar for easy access, and you can search Enter any city name and get a detailed report on the daily weather as well as the upcoming five day forecast. All city searches are saved in the sidebar so that you can quickly access them and stay up-to-date. 

I use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and use it in the context of this app.
